## Smart Travel
Agent that plans and books entire vacations. A user could provide a budget, travel dates, and interests (e.g., "a relaxing beach vacation in Southeast Asia for under $2,000"), and the agent would research destinations, compare flight and hotel options, and present a complete, bookable itinerary.
