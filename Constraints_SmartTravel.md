# Smart Travel Projectâ€™s Constraints

#### Team: Sethu Kruthin Nagari & Sai Venkata Subhash Vakkalagadda

The Smart Travel project's design and implementation are shaped by several critical restrictions. Economically, the team works with little resources, depending mostly on free and open-source tools like Python libraries, PostgreSQL databases, and public APIs for trip information. There is no external financing or business sponsorship, thus access to premium APIs or commercial hosting services is limited. This constraint necessitates the development of a cost-effective architecture that maximizes performance while lowering expenses.

From an ethical aspect, the system must ensure that AI behaves responsibly when proposing destinations, avoiding biased or dangerous travel suggestions. The team must ensure that the algorithm does not favor specific areas or demographics unjustly, and that user data is treated publicly and respectfully.  

In terms of legal limits, Smart Travel must adhere to data protection standards such as the GDPR and CCPA, particularly because it handles sensitive user data such as names, budgets, and preferences. To avoid intellectual property difficulties, all external APIs and datasets must be properly licensed and attributed.  

Finally, security limits are critical for the project's profitability. As consumers disclose sensitive travel information, data encryption, secure authentication, and secure API connectivity are critical. The team must safeguard against data breaches, eavesdropping, and the misuse of stored information.  

Overall, these restrictions govern the team's efforts to create a system that is cost-effective, ethical, compliant, and secure, ensuring Smart Travel's continued functionality and social responsibility.
